# Menu App

### My solution of interview task.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Task Description

1. Create a new React app by running:

   `npx create-react-app menu-app --template typescript`

   or

   `yarn create react-app menu-app --template typescript`

2. Fetch the data from [https://pair-programming-test.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cuisine.json](https://pair-programming-test.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cuisine.json) and display the name of each meal in a list.

You can keep or remove as much boilerplate code as you want.

### What are we looking for from you?

1. We are looking at what you know, how you work and how you communicate. We **are not** testing your memory.
2. Show off your knowledge. If there isnâ€™t time to do something, talk it through. **We want to see:**
    1. How you structure code
    2. Your testing approach
    3. Pragmatism with the time available
